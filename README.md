# Syrinscape-Online-URI-Handler

This simple URI handler is designed to pick up Syrinscape Online URI's and send them to the Syrisncape REST API for playback.  The author developed this to work with the Syrinscape Online player, and the Fantasy Grounds Syrinscape Sounds extension.  

This software has only been tested on Ubuntu.

Use at your own risk.
